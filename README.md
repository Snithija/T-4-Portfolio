# T-4-Portfolio

This is my **React + Vite** project: a portfolio website designed from a Figma desktop view.

## Project Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

### Plugins Used

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) – uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Notes

- The React Compiler is not enabled in this template. To add it, see [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
- For production applications, TypeScript with type-aware ESLint rules is recommended. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for integration.

## Description

- Fully responsive portfolio website
- Built following a Figma design
- Includes Navbar, Footer, and project sections
